
This game tells the story of a hero's treasure hunt. Winning the game means the hero needs to collect 
five artefacts and successfully take them out of the treasure cave. There are 20 small caves in the treasure 
cavern, each cave is connected to the other three caves. When entering each cave, there is a possibility of 
encountering the minions and dragons guarding the treasure. The player has a chance to get artefacts or treasures 
after defeating the enemies. If you fail to defeat the enemy, the hero will die and the game will end.

The player's initial equipment are a map and a lantern. The lantern has a limited amount of oil, and the player 
needs to successfully obtain the treasure and leave the cave before the oil runs out. Each turn, the player has 
the opportunity to move to the next cave and finding the treasure. When encountering enemies, the player can choose 
whether to fight with them. Players have the opportunity to pick up weapons or armor, which can increase damage and 
defense abilities. There are five levels of monsters, the higher the level, the stronger the damage ability. It is 
recommended that players get to acquire as much equipment and item as possible to improve their attributes before 
challenging high level monsters.
